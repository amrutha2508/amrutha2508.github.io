* MS in Statistics - Data Science **(GPA:3.929/4)**

### Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (Aug. 2018 - Aug. 2022)
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science


## Work Experience
### Part-time lecturer, Data 101 Course (Sept 2024 - present)
#### Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University 
* Delivered simplified explanations of data science concepts to a non-technical audience.
* Developed instructional materials centered on practical R programming skills and offered real-time support to address
student questions, overseeing a class of 28 through both in-person and online.

## Projects
### Workforce Analytics | [Git](https://github.com/amrutha2508/HR-Data-Analysis/tree/main)
* Developed a machine learning model to predict employee turnover and enhance retention by identifying key departure factors through visual and statistical analyses.
* Addressed potential data leakage through feature engineering by excluding biased variables, scaling data, and handling outliers and correlations to improve model performance.
* Evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, achieving a Random Forest AUC of 0.97, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.89, and provided recommendations to address overworking and improve employee retention.

### TikTok Claim Classification | [Git](https://github.com/amrutha2508/TikTokClaimClassification)
* Built a machine learning model to classify TikTok video reports as claims or opinions, streamlining the review process, reducing the backlog, and enhancing reviewer efficiency.
* Performed feature engineering with CountVectorizer for text data, log transformations for numerical features, and selective outlier imputations to enhance model performance and interpretability, minimizing false negatives in identifying potential policy violations.
* Built and assessed models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving a recall of 0.995 with Random Forest for near-perfect precision and f1-scores in video report classification.

### NYC Taxi Fair Analysis | [Git](https://github.com/amrutha2508/NYCTaxiFairAnalysis)
* Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using NYC Taxi data to predict fare amounts, achieving an R2 score of 0.871.
* Handled outliers and transformed skewed variables during feature engineering, boosting model performance.Used
ANOVA tests to assess fare differences across categorical features and identify key predictors.

### Twitter Search Application | [Git](https://github.com/amrutha2508/AdvDataScience_Project)
* Built a search application for a Twitter dataset that allows users to perform searches based on usernames, hashtags, keywords, top ten metrics, and time ranges.
* Used PostgreSQL and MongoDB for user and tweet data storage respectively. A cache system is implemented using LRU technique. A simple user-friendly UI is developed for users to perform searches.
